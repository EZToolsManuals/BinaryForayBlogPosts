# ShellBags Explorer 0.9.5.0 released!

Posted: 7th September 2017

Changes in this version include:

NEW: Additional GUIDs added
NEW: Several new Shellbag types and extension blocks added
NEW: SBECmd.exe can now process the live registry on the system it runs on via the -l switch
CHANGE: SBECmd.exe now looks recursively for ntuser.dat and usrclass.dat files in the directory specified (Previously it only looked in the directory specified)

Most of the changes are under the hood in the GUI, but there are several changes made to SBECmd.exe. Let's take a look at these a bit closer

#### Reading ShellBags from a live system

A new switch, -l (lower case L), tells SBECmd to process the live registry vs an offline hive. With this change, you must specify either -l or -d (but not both obviously).

Here is an example:

The name of the export file is based off the timestamp when SBECmd was executed as well as the machine name it was run on.

#### Recursive processing of directories

In previous versions, SBECmd only looked at the directory specified via the -d switch for hives. This version changes that so that all directories are searched recursively for hives that contain shellbags.

Let's say you used X-Ways to filter for all ntuser.dat and usrclass.dat files in a case. You then export those files out and use the option to recreate the original path and end up with something like this:

The -d switch, when passed the value of 'c:\temp\ntfs' would then find all the hives and process them, saving out one tsv file per hive. The results would look something like this:

The full path to the hive is used for the output file so you can easily reference back to the hive where it came from.

These tsv files can now be ingested into your tool of choice for further processing.

Thanks to David Cowen for the live registry processing request! Someone else requested the recursive feature and I tried to find that request to give credit but I could not find it. Thank you too!
