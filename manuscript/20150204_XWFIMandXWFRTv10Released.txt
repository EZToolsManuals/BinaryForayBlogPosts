# XWFIM and XWFRT v1.0 released!

Posted: 4th February 2015

### **XWFIM and XWFRT version 1.0 now available!**

XWFIM Changes include:

NEW: Full proxy support via Tools menu
NEW: Support for BYOD downloads
CHANGE: You can now make a portable installation on any device vs removable only
FIX: Detect when 'Append version #' option is active when creating portable install

You can download the update here or just start XWFIM to get the latest version.

#### **BYOD**

You don't have to do anything differently for BYOD downloads. Just enter the username and password you received for the BYOD download and XWFIM will detect it and do the rest

#### **Proxy support**

You can access Proxy settings via the Tools menu. XWFIM has been tested by myself and several users. I tested it against a Squid proxy without issue.
