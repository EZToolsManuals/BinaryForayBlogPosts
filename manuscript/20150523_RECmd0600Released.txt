# RECmd 0.6.0.0 released!

Posted: 23rd May 2015

Original link: https://binaryforay.blogspot.com/2015/05/recmd-0600-released.html

This version adds some new features and a bit of polish. Changes include:

New: Added --Sort that will sort the output according to the type of data returned (size for MinSize, time stamps for date range searches, etc)
New: Added --SuppressData. If present, do not show data when using --sd or --nd

Change: Make output consistent
Change: When searching for value data, show the value's data vs just the key and value name

Here is an example of the adjusted output for time stamp searches (time stamps are first now):

A sorting example:

And finally, when searching for value data, show the data itself vs. just value name.

You can suppress data values from being shown by using the --SuppressData switch.

Additionally, when searching for key names, only keys are shown and when searching for values, the key name and value name are shown.
