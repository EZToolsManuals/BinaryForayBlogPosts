# ShellBags Explorer 0.5.4.0 released!

Posted: 17th February 2015

This release contains the following changes:

CHANGE: Replace custom logging code with NLog
FIX: A few cosmetic fixes to ShellBag details output
FIX: Registry parser bug fixes on some fringe cases

The biggest change for this version is swapping out old custom logging stuff with NLog. This makes things much more flexible as any of the NLog targets can now be used for logging. Future releases will possibly support using an NLog.config file so end users can control what gets logged and to where (files, databases, email, etc).

ShellBags Explorer is also using the new logging under the hood, but it will look and feel pretty much the same since all output goes to the Messages window.

Here is what SBECmd.exe looks like now:
