# RECmd 0.6.1.0 released!

Posted: 3rd June 2015

This version is mostly cleanup and slight formatting changes to make things easier to use.
You can get the updated version here or on Github
Changes include:
CHANGE: Clean up command line option language, added another example with AM/PM vs 24 hour time format
CHANGE: Add root key name to top of output since its always the same
CHANGE: Strip root key name from output so output is more succinct.
CHANGE: General output formatting clean up ('value' vs 'values' when one result found, etc.)
CHANGE: Added subkey info (# of subkeys and basic subkey details) when dumping a key via --KeyName
CHANGE: Updated Registry back end to tweak formatting of output when dumping values via --ValueName

Here you can see the updated output showing the root key once at the top vs in every key. This cuts down on the amount of data displayed, especially when a lot of matches are found

When dumping a key, the number of subkeys is shown as well as a listing of the subkeys. Previously only the values were listed.

Finally, the format for showing values has been updated to condense the info. Previously, each property of the value was reported on a separate line. Now the type is in line with the name and slack is only shown when it exists.
