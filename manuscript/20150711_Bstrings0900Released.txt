# bstrings 0.9.0.0 released

Posted: 11th July 2015

Original link: https://binaryforay.blogspot.com/2015/07/bstrings-0900-released.html

A few minor changes based on feedback and wiring up final options.

NEW: More RegEx patterns
NEW: Show RegEx descriptions vs the pattern for -p
NEW: Show the RegEx pattern being used in output
NEW: Save to option now works (-o). Only the search hits will be saved to the file, not what is shown on the console.

CHANGE: When using --ls, make the search case insensitive

This program is open source. The code is available [here](https://github.com/EricZimmerman/bstrings).

#### Benchmarks

I also did some quick benchmarks against a 6 MB Registry hive using Sysinternals strings.exe. The benchmark was recorded via PowerShell's Measure-Command function.

bstrings TotalSeconds                         : 10.0237084
Sysinternals strings TotalSeconds       : 40.2289262

Based on these numbers, bstrings is ~75% faster than strings.

The -o option now works as well.

Only the hits are saved to the target file. If you want all of the console output, use redirection.
