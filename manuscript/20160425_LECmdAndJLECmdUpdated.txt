# LECmd and JLECmd updated

Posted: 25th April 2016

[Tom Yarrish](https://twitter.com/CdtDelta) (via Harrison Mbugi) was doing some testing with LECmd and noticed the target modified and target accessed times were transposed. This issue was tracked down and fixed in my lnk project.

This is what version 0.7.0 was showing:

This is what X-Ways shows for the same lnk file:

And the same file in LECmd 0.7.1.0:

Since LECmd and JLECmd both use this library, both were updated (along with several nuget packages).

Thanks Tom!
