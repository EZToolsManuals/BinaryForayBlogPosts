Last week, the esteemed David Cowen [@HECFBlog](https://twitter.com/HECFBlog) reported a bug when using the -d option I recently added.

Specifically, he reported an error related to long file names:

So I created some long file paths, added a fix, and then did some testing.

Here is the before and after:

So now you should be able to search arbitrary data for strings regardless of how crazy the paths get!

Get it here or on [GitHub](https://github.com/EricZimmerman/bstrings).
