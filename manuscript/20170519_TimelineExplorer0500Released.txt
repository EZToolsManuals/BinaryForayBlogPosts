# Timeline Explorer 0.5.0.0 released

Posted: 19th May 2017

Some user requested changes in this version.

Changelog:

NEW: Add Tools | Go to line # to quickly jump to a given line
NEW: Can tag rows via clicking on Tag cell vs needing to use shortcut
NEW: Added an incremental search box to top of main form. Use buttons to navigate results (CTRL-Left and CTRL-Right also navigate search results)

FIX: Remove tab for files TLE couldn't load

#### Incremental search

Here we see the new incremental search box which allows you to find a string and then navigate to each hit via the arrow keys in the search box or by using CTRL-Left and CTRL-Right arrows to select the previous or next hit in the list.

The currently selected hit is shown with a green background.

#### Other changes

You can tag rows by clicking on the Tag box vs having to use a hot key.

The Go to line # hotkey allows for jumping to a specific line number in the file:

and once you hit OK, you are magically transported to that row:
