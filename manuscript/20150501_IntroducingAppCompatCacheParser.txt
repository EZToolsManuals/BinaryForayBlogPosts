Yesterday I got a request to put together a utility to dump shimcache entries from the Registry. Today it is available!

Windows 7 (x86 and x84), Windows 8.x (Server 2012* as well), and Windows 10 are all supported.

You can get the binary here or browse the source on GitHub, so if you want to contribute or see how it works, [check it out](https://github.com/EricZimmerman/AppCompatCacheParser).

There are 2 files included:

AppCompatCacheParser.exe
NLog.config

Both are required. You can adjust the nlog.config file as needed to push logging to any other source you need to.

Usage is pretty straightforward:

The only required option is -s, so the program knows where to save things to. If you omit the -h option, the live Registry is dumped.

Notice the name of the machine is used (HAX0R in this case) when dumping the live system.

Here are some more examples. The program will take less than a second to run.

Output is in TSV format and entries are saved in files as follows:

Windows7X64_SYSTEM_AppCompatCache.tsv
Windows7X86_SYSTEM_AppCompatCache.tsv
Windows10_SYSTEM_AppCompatCache.tsv
Windows81_SYSTEMWin81_AppCompatCache.tsv

In short, its {OperatingSystem}_{HiveName}_AppCompatCache.tsv

Please hit me up if you want any additional features.

Enjoy!

PS If you are wondering what that console thing is, its cmder and its awesome.
