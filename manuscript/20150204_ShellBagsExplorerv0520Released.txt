### Deleted ShellBags

Registry Explorer has the ability to recover and display deleted keys and values. Looking at a hive with deleted ShellBags looks like this:

Since Registry Explorer and SBE both use the same back end to parse hives, SBE now has the ability to detect deleted ShellBag entries. When they are found, a red X will be displayed to the right of the name in the tree and the Details view will also note the fact that the ShellBag was deleted.

Here we see the grid reflects the deleted ShellBags as well.
