# The end of XWFRT?

Starting with X-Ways Forensics 18.1, the report format generated by X-Ways Forensics was dramatically changed, breaking XWFRT.

Today X-Ways Forensics 18.2 Beta 3 was released. One of the changes included this (the key part is in bold):

* "Create main report" is now a 3-state checkbox in the case report options dialog. If only half checked, details about the evidence objects are not included in the case report, the evidence objects are merely listed. Evidence objects details, if included, now precede report tables in the report. **Links to report tables now work even if the report is optionally split into multiple HTML files, and there is a link back from each report table to the report table overview. The report is now split based on the number of items that are referenced, not based on the number of pictures that are displayed in the report. If the report is split, the next segment is now linked from the bottomof the previous segment.**

The previous behavior of X-Ways reporting was the primary reason XWFRT was created. The breaking changes in 18.1 necessitated a rewrite of XWFRT anyways but with the above change I do not know if the effort is worth it unless the community deems otherwise.

I have tested the new functionality and it works very well, linking to other HTML files and back to the main report as links are clicked.

I have suggested a few other tweaks to default X-Ways reports that hopefully make it into 18.2 release.

If XWFRT does something you cannot live without, please let me know and I will see what I can do.
