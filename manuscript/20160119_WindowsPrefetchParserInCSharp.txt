NOTE: Here is a [link](http://binaryforay.blogspot.com/2016/01/pecmd-v0600-released.html) to a post on PECmd, my command line parser that uses the code that is discussed below.

I recently completed a Windows Prefetch file parser in C# that is available [here](https://github.com/EricZimmerman/Prefetch).

This project will serve as the basis for a GUI and Cmd line tool similar to how ShellBags Explorer and SBECmd work.

There is a TON of data in these things and I hope this project will enable people to do more research into things to find new ways to use Prefetch files.

What do you want a Prefetch tool to do? Leave your requests in the comments or hit me up via email!

Here is an example of the kind of information that is exposed:
