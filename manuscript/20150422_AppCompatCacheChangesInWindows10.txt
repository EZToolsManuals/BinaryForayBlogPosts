# AppCompatCache changes in Windows 10

Posted: 22nd April 2015

The AppCompatCache value lives at SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\AppCompatCache.

In Windows 7, 8.0, and 8.1, the header is 128 bytes in size (more details here)

I recently added AppCompatCache support to my live response tool and when I tested it on Windows 10, I didn't get any shimcache entries.

Looking at a Windows 10 SYSTEM hive in a hex editor shows:

As you can see, the header is now 48 bytes in length. The signature, 10ts, remains the same in Windows 10 as it was for Windows 8.1.

As one would expect when it comes to this artifact, Microsoft has once again introduced another format. From my testing it looks like it breaks down as follows (subject to change):

Using this information I was able to extract 350 cache entries from my Windows 10 SYSTEM hive. This matches the value we see in the header as well.

Another very interesting thing that I found in cache entries were things like this:

I haven't done enough research into what these may mean for us yet. 

Time to update your code vendors =)
