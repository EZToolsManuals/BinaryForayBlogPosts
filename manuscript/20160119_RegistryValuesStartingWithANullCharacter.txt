# Registry values starting with a NULL character

On January 19, Harlan blogged here about Registry values that start with the NULL character (00). He wrote a plugin for RegRipper to detect such keys.

After reading about it I wanted to see of my Registry code handled this case as well.

The test hive has two values located at Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run that look like this:

As you can see, there are two values in the Run key, but the names appear to have some empty space on the left side.

If we look at the Technical details for this key and click on the 'Value count' property, we see this:

So the NK record (the key) says there should be two values. So far so good!

Looking at the Values tab shows us:

I clicked on the 'Name' property on the right side and the bytes that make up the name are highlighted. As you can see, there is a NULL character at the beginning of the string.

Based on this, Registry Explorer, RECmd, and anything else that uses my [Registry](https://github.com/EricZimmerman/Registry) parsing code handles this use case with ease.

Enjoy!
