If we run the same search with the -q option, only the matches are returned.

#### Final thoughts

One thing to keep in mind is that when the string count is being reported in the initial search, it is the total number of strings found in a file and NOT the total number of strings that match the --lr or --ls option.

The other thing to keep in mind is that all strings are trimmed for white space (both before and after the string). In the examples below you can see the empty string being removed in the final count (238,155 found including "", but 238,154 strings are actually displayed).

I did some testing with different block sizes to see if there was any changes in processing speed or results. I used block sizes of 152, 256, and 512 MB. The summaries are below.
