# Benchmark followup: Big(ger) data and Raw vs E01

Posted: 12th September 2016

NOTE: This blog post's images were not available at the time of publication.

As requested on the Forensic Lunch and elsewhere, I have done some additional testing to see how a few of the tools handle larger data sets (122 GB E01) and raw images vs E01.

Since I added another data set and another image format, I slightly adjusted the spreadsheet Data Size column. It now has the format of "Compressed size/Uncompressed size/Free space"

The spreadsheet is also updated with these numbers.

### Large data set

This test consisted of using data from a recent case which was a 122 GB E01 image. The idea was to see if FTK and X-Ways (the two tools I was tasked to test in this regard with my employer) to see how the tools scaled to larger data sets.

These tests were conducted on the CFA21 box.

When it came to search hits, things look like this:

Where Delta is the difference between X-Ways hits and FTK hits.

### Raw vs E01

I used the same data set as the original testing for this and just converted the E01 image to a raw image using X-Ways.

The X-Ways Raw test on ERZ was done using version 19b1.
