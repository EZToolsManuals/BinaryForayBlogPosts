# LECmd v0.6.0.0 released!

Posted: 16th February 2016

Original link: https://binaryforay.blogspot.com/2016/02/lecmd-v0600-released.html

Changes in this version include:

NEW: Added -q switch for quiet operation. Useful to suppress output to screen when using the various export options
NEW: Added --xml switch for XML output. This expects a directory name
NEW: Added --html switch for Html (well, xhtml + css) output. This expects a directory name

CHANGE: Handle cases where people use strange options for some of the switches

FIX: Corrected flip flopped TargetModified and TargetLastAccessed timestamp in output. The parser is right, but LECmd had the properties reversed.

I did some general refactoring here and there as well.

Let's take a look at some of the changes

When exporting to csv, html, xml, and/or json, the -q switch prevents LECmd from displaying all the details about a lnk file. This greatly speeds up processing.

Without using -q, processing 998 lnk files takes around 20 seconds, but if we use -q, the same processing is far quicker, as can be seen below.

As you can see, we now finish the job in 1.03 seconds!! Not too shabby

LECmd already supported json export, but this release adds XML (which works the same as exporting json) and HTML export options.

XML export is basically the same data available in CSV export, but in XML format, as seen below:

When LECmd exports XML, it is all on a single line. I formatted things in the image above so you can see the kinds of info available in there.

LECMD can also generate a nice HTML report for your lnk files. Using the --html switch results in a new folder being created in the directory passed into the --html switch.

For example, if you exported HTML to c:\Temp, your HTML results would be created in:

c:\temp\20160216205056_LECmd_Output_for_c_Temp_

{pagebreak}

The new folder starts with a timestamp followed by 'LECmd', followed by the path processed (with colons and slashes converted to underscores).

Inside this folder will be three files:

index.xhtml
normalize.css
style.css

The css files control the look and feel of the report, so if you are into customization you can change these to suit your tastes.

index.xhtml contains all the data and, when combined with the css definitions, ends up looking like this in a browser (I used Chrome, but any should work):

That's it for this release. Get it [here](http://binaryforay.blogspot.com/p/software.html) or on Github.

P.S. PECmd will also be getting HTML export in its next release
